  [*Key Concepts Learned:*], [*Application in Real Projects:*],
  
  [These past weeks primarily covered Configuration Management and Project Planning. Configuration Management introduced structured approaches to controlling software changes through four key functions: configuration identification, control, status accounting, and audits. The importance of change impact analysis became clear, along with understanding why software's invisibility makes uncontrolled changes problematic. Project Planning topics included Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), resource allocation, Critical Path Method (CPM), Goldratt's Critical Chain Method, and distinguishing milestones from deliverables. Brooks' Law, that adding people to late projects makes them later, was particularly memorable, highlighting communication overhead challenges. Risk estimation frameworks and their integration with planning methodologies helped to deepen my understanding of managing complex projects effectively.],
  
  [I am gaining a more practical understanding of the benefits of what we are learning in class and how they would apply when planning new projects. Configuration management, for instance, addresses real challenges in maintaining version control and managing change requests that I can envision encountering in the workforce. Risk estimation and the planning techniques we covered help me reflect on my potential responsibilities once I enter the workforce and have to manage industry-level projects. The lessons on resource allocation and task dependencies make me consider how I would approach breaking down complex software projects and coordinating team efforts effectively. This practical grounding helps bridge the gap between academic concepts and real-world project management scenarios I will likely face in my career.],

  [*Peer Interactions:*], [*Challenges Faced:*],
  
  [I am the team leader for the group project, which has proven both rewarding and challenging. Coordinating with everyone, answering their questions, and helping to revise others' work to create a cohesive report mirrors many of the same challenges I face as a teaching assistant. The leadership responsibilities have forced me to develop skills in delegation, conflict resolution, and ensuring everyone understands their roles and deadlines. It led to me, for example, revising my expectations for appropriate time estimation and management to ensure proper buffering. It has reinforced that technical knowledge alone is insufficient, thus effective communication and team coordination are equally critical for project success.],

  [The topic analysis deliverable went fine overall, however I initially misunderstood the requirements. Coming from a biology background, I approached it as creating a scientific poster—something visually detailed and data-heavy. It turned out to be more simple and straightforward than I expected, which was a learning moment about clarifying assignment expectations early. The midterm exam presented some tough questions that tested my understanding more deeply than I anticipated. I felt confident going into the exam, but certain questions revealed gaps in my knowledge, making me realize I need to revise topics from previous chapters that I thought I had nailed down.  Time management continues to be my biggest ongoing challenge, as balancing full-time work, graduate studies, and teaching assistant responsibilities leaves little breathing room in my schedule.],
  
  [*Personal development activities:*], [*Goals for the Next Week:*],
  
  [I am still learning how to be an effective teaching assistant and team leader. These dual roles push me out of my comfort zone regularly, requiring me to guide others while managing my own workload. Thankfully, the lessons learned from this course are helping me develop these skills and tackle leadership challenges better for the next course deliverables. My reserve army training provides some foundation, but leading in academic and project contexts requires different approaches—more collaborative and less hierarchical. The experience is building my confidence in making decisions, providing constructive feedback, and coordinating multiple moving parts simultaneously, all skills I anticipate will be essential in my future career.],
  
  [My immediate focus for the next period will go towards solidifying my understanding of the topics that challenged me during the midterm. I want to ensure that foundational concepts are firmly grasped before we build upon them further. For the upcoming group deliverables, I plan to apply the project planning techniques we learned more rigorously, particularly in creating detailed task breakdowns and realistic schedules with proper dependency mapping. I hope to improve my leadership effectiveness by seeking feedback from team members about what is working and what could be better in our coordination. Finally, I aim to develop better time management strategies, possibly by identifying my true constraints and protecting focus time more aggressively, rather than spreading myself too thin across all responsibilities.],
