  [*Key Concepts Learned:*], [*Application in Real Projects:*],
  
  [The past weeks focused primarily on Project monitoring and control, as well as Project closure. Monitoring involves collecting data to measure progress and ensuring the team implements the plan correctly, while control ensures the project delivers according to schedule, cost, and quality by taking corrective action when necessary. Earned Value Management (EVM) emerged as a particularly important tool, integrating both schedule and budget control through metrics like planned value, earned value, and actual cost to calculate variances. Project closure activities were also covered, including the importance of archiving project data, version control management, and documenting lessons learned for future projects. Understanding how monitoring feeds into closure activities highlighted the continuous nature of project management throughout the entire lifecycle.],
  
  [The lessons on DevOps have significantly refined my understanding of the practice, which aligns perfectly with my career aspirations in this field. Building on my previous goal to catalogue course frameworks as career templates, I now feel considerably more confident in my ability to analyze and lead projects once I enter the workforce. However, challenges remain in conceptualizing how certain quantitative models like COCOMO and EVM translate to industry practice. Additionally, I'm considering how EVM metrics could be visualized in project dashboards to provide real-time insights, transforming abstract calculations into actionable project health indicators that stakeholders can readily interpret.],

  [*Peer Interactions:*], [*Challenges Faced:*],
  
 [Coordinating with my team members has become increasingly challenging as the final exam deadline approaches and assignments accumulate across multiple courses. Group members are collaborating less frequently than before, with many expressing their own difficulties managing the workload. The mounting pressure has forced me to reconsider my approach to leadership and delegation. In another group project this term, I made the deliberate choice to step back from the team leader role and assign it to a peer, which proved remarkably successful. This experience taught me that I don't need to control every aspect of a project to ensure quality outcomes. The sudden workload spike even led me to cancel some military reserve activities, which reinforced the importance of involving the entire team in decision-making processes rather than centralizing everything with the leader.],

 [Time management remains my most persistent challenge this session. Alongside more assignments, several classes have experienced a significant spike in content that will be covered on their final exams, demanding additional study time I hadn't anticipated. This situation became more urgent when I recently discovered that the final exam period for graduate students occurs earlier than for undergraduate students. This compressed timeline has forced me to readjust my study strategies and priorities. Compounding these pressures is the fact that the exam format itself will include both multiple choice and short answer questions. I've sometimes struggled with articulating my knowledge in written form even when I understand the material well, so this format presents an additional layer of difficulty that requires deliberate practice and preparation.],
  
  [*Personal development activities:*], [*Goals for the Next Week:*],
  
  [My role as a teaching assistant continues to evolve as I develop new strategies to speed up grading and provide meaningful feedback. I've focused on better coordination with other TAs, planning detailed grading rubrics in advance, and tailoring feedback for each group, which has significantly improved efficiency. I attended this year's DevFest conference, which proved invaluable for understanding how different teams and companies manage real software projects using both proven methodologies and experimental AI tools. I have noticed that the insights gained directly complement what we're learning in class as several concepts we have explored were demonstrated in real-life contexts. Additionally, I've begun preparing internship applications through my Co-op program, building on my group project experience for soft skill development and interview prep.],
  
  [My primary goal for next week is to clear out as many assignments and group projects as possible to free up dedicated studying time for the final exams. I need to revisit Chapters 6 and 8, as I don't feel I've properly grasped certain concepts, specifically EVM and closure activities. As a teaching assistant, I must prepare students for their upcoming final coding project, calculate and enter their final assignment and project grades, and provide additional support to students who are struggling. I've noticed a concerning dip in work quality from several groups, which likely reflects the same time pressures I'm experiencing.],
