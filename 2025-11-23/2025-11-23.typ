  [*Overall Course Impact:*], [*Application in Professional Life:*],

  [
    This course has proven invaluable in transforming my understanding of software project management from abstract concepts into more tangible understanding. With previous courses, my particular concern was that we focused more on the technical aspects of software development than on the team dynamics and planning methodologies that determine whether projects succeed or fail. Having undergone undergraduate co-op, I recognized this gap firsthand with daily workplace challenges that differed significantly from academic exercises, and I often wished I had possessed formal knowledge of project management. The progression from foundational concepts like SMART goals and estimation models through to configuration management, monitoring, and closure provided a comprehensive perspective I felt I had previously lacked. One such example included the learning of COCOMO and industry-wide estimation models for which I had no prior knowledge of and which have allowed me to understand how we approach software project estimation and avoid potential pitfalls. It is hoped that the materials I have compiled from this course will serve as templates over the course of my career.

  [The knowledge gained directly supports my career aspirations in DevOps and software project leadership. Frameworks like WBS, CPM, and EVM provide concrete tools I can envision applying when planning and monitoring industry-level projects. The lessons on resource allocation and task dependencies have made me consider how I would approach breaking down complex software projects and coordinating team efforts effectively. Attending this year's DevFest conference reinforced this connection, as I spoke directly with industry professionals applying the exact methodologies we studied in real-life contexts. One such context was the internal development of agentic AI, requiring a dedicated team of various experts that work on the cutting edge and possess more relaxed project requirements and specifications. It was revealed that this project methodology could contradict certain course teachings such as the rigorous application of pre-planning and estimation. Long-term, this course has helped position me for DevSecOps or MLOps roles wherein I will be juggling many different responsibilities, and potentially many teams, across different domains all at once.

  [*Peer Collaboration Insights:*], [*Personal Growth:*],

  [I found peer interactions challenging, testing social, intellectual, and collaborative competencies simultaneously. Coordination with all team members, answering questions, and revising others' work to create cohesive reports mirrored some of the same challenges I face as a teaching assistant. Early in the term, a peer's explanation of estimation by analogy, as an example, provided a breakthrough in my understanding of project sizing that exemplified how collaborative learning deepens understanding beyond individual study. As deadlines accumulated, group members collaborated less frequently, forcing me to reconsider my leadership approach. In another project, I deliberately stepped back from the leader role, which proved remarkably successful and taught me that quality outcomes don't require controlling every aspect. With final exams approaching, tensions would sometimes develop both internally and between members, with my reserve army training providing techniques to mitigate or remove stressors. It is personally felt, however, that academic, and more specifically civilian, contexts require more collaborative and less hierarchical approaches.],

  [My most significant growth occurred through the intersection of this course with my teaching assistant responsibilities. Instead of being guided, I am now guiding undergraduate students through similar software engineering concepts, thus forcing me to solidify my understanding whilst at the same time improving my instructional effectiveness through course content learning. Time management represented my most persistent challenge throughout this session, as balancing full-time work, graduate studies, and TA responsibilities left little breathing room for procrastination or inefficient scheduling. Confronting this constraint repeatedly, however, built resilience and forced continuous refinement of my prioritization strategies. This has been the busiest session of my life thus far, which has definitely led to reflections on my personal growth and performance in the face of challenges and managing complexity under pressure.],
