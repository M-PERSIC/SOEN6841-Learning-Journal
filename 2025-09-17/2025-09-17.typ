  [*Key Concepts Learned:*], [*Application in Real Projects:*],
  
  [We were first introduced to some of the fundamentals of software project management. We first synopsized the main project tasks and models (e.g., waterfall), followed by an overview of SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) goals and how to apply them to better shape our project objectives and sub objectives. The second week, we dove into estimation models (by analogy, by expert judgement) and of the different estimation models with unique strengths and weaknesses of estimation models including Function Point Analysis and COCOMO. Finally, we learned risk analysis, its different facets (identification, analysis, prioritization, etc.), and a number of strategies and models  (e.g, risk reduction leverage, both qualitative and quantitive modeling, etc.) to better assess overall project risk.],
  
  [The lessons presented have thus far proven to be personally invaluable. My particular worry, with previous courses, was that we were more focused on the technical aspects of software development than on the team/workplace dynamics and challenges. Having undergone undergraduate co-op, the daily challenges were much different than in academia, and, when given charge of projects or of others, previous knowledge of project management tools and frameworks would have proven beneficial. SMART goals, for example, was a model I had previously learnt and helped better shape my work project objectives that they were more realistic and achievable within strict timeframes. My hope is to catalogue these models and frameworks so that I may use them as templates over the course of my career to improve my project management skills.],

  [*Peer Interactions:*], [*Challenges Faced:*],
  
  [I find peer interactions to be intimidating, challenging social, intellectual, and collaborative competencies. This time, the initial process proceeded smoothly, as my team members are attentive and understand our collective responsibilities. During a discussion on estimation models, a peer's explanation of Estimation by Analogy, using examples of comparing project elements like "tables in DB", provided a breakthrough in my understanding of project sizing and decomposition. As well, notable progress was made towards establishing our current goals and expectations as the first project deadline approaches. My reserve army training has helped me better engage in a team and analyze member and team dynamics.],

  [Time management has represented the biggest challenge faced thus far. For these first 2 weeks, I have been working full-time, studying full-time, and have recently been onboarded as an undergraduate teaching assistant. Along with family and friends, this has led to an immense load of work that has led me to be stranded at the library for days on end. Ideally, the initial load is not representative of the rest of the session and I can continue to refine my time management skills. Concerning the course, I am having trouble understanding some of the estimate and risk assessment models, such as COCOMO and quantitative risk assessment. I feel like additional, practical examples will help me learn how to apply these concepts and understand the formulas and nuances of these models.],
  
  [*Personal development activities:*], [*Goals for the Next Week:*],
  
  [Becoming a teaching assistant is turning into one of my most major personal development activities. Instead of being guided, I am now guiding undergraduate students on their graded tasks. It is up to me and a team of other teaching assistants to coordinate, communicate, design assignments and projects, and ensure students receive a good learning experience. It is hoped that the skills acquired and developed , specifically team leadership and project grading, will improve my competencies overall when working on software project management. As well, it will help reinforce my learning of this topic since this undergraduate course explore many of the same concepts as in this course (introduction to software engineering), and it represents a smaller-scale version of the graduate course I took previously.],
  
  [My immediate focus for next week is to complete the topic analysis. Due to my current schedule, I have significantly less time to work on it, and therefore must prioritize my efforts and put my coordination skills to the test with my teammate in order to see it to completion. Following the topic analysis, I will focus on removing any lapses in understanding from the lessons of these first two weeks, as well as prepare for the next topics covered. I hope to be able to rethink my studying strategies in order to determine any inefficiencies and improve accordingly so that I can create more breathing room in my schedule overall. As I am submitting this learning journal entry early, I hope to better schedule my submissions the next time around in spite of full-time work and thus not cut my updates short.],
